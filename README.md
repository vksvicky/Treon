# Treon

Pure C++ JSON viewer/formatter and query tool with Qt Quick UI. Two-pane interface (tree + formatted text), jq/JSONPath support, file history, and scripting capabilities. High-performance implementation inspired by OK JSON ([docs](https://docs.okjson.app/)).

## Architecture
- **Core Library**: C++ JSON parsing, validation, and data models
- **UI Layer**: Qt Quick for modern, responsive interface
- **Services**: File management, directory memory, error handling
- **Testing**: Comprehensive unit tests and BDD scenarios

- ðŸ”„ CLI interface (planned)

## Build Requirements
- **Qt 6.5+**: Modern Qt Quick framework
- **CMake 3.20+**: Build system
- **C++20**: Modern C++ features
- **Platforms**: macOS, Linux, Windows

## Quick Start
```bash
# Install dependencies (macOS)
brew install qt6 cmake

# Build and run
make build
make run-app

# Or use the simple launcher
./run debug

# Run tests
make test
```

## Development
```bash
# Setup development environment
make dev-setup

# Build application
make build

# Run in different modes
./run debug          # Debug mode
./run release        # Release mode
./run dev            # Development mode
./run watch          # Watch for changes
./run debugger       # With debugger
./run profile        # With profiling

# Or use make targets
make dev             # Development mode
make watch           # Watch mode
make debug           # Debug mode
make profile         # Profile mode

# Run tests
make test

# Clean build artifacts
make clean
```

## Run Scripts

### Simple Launcher (`./run`)
Quick launcher with common commands:
- `./run debug` - Debug mode (default)
- `./run release` - Release mode
- `./run dev` - Development mode
- `./run watch` - Watch for changes
- `./run debugger` - With debugger
- `./run profile` - With profiling

### Advanced Runner (`scripts/run_app.sh`)
Full-featured application runner:
```bash
# Basic usage
./scripts/run_app.sh debug
./scripts/run_app.sh release

# With debugging tools
./scripts/run_app.sh debug --gdb
./scripts/run_app.sh debug --valgrind
./scripts/run_app.sh debug --profile

# Verbose output
./scripts/run_app.sh debug --verbose
```

### Development Runner (`scripts/dev_run.sh`)
Development-focused runner with hot reload:
```bash
# Development commands
./scripts/dev_run.sh run          # Run application
./scripts/dev_run.sh build        # Build only
./scripts/dev_run.sh test         # Run tests
./scripts/dev_run.sh watch        # Watch mode
./scripts/dev_run.sh debug        # Debug mode
./scripts/dev_run.sh profile      # Profile mode
./scripts/dev_run.sh clean        # Clean build
```

## Known Issues

### File Size Limitations

**Recommended File Sizes:**
- **Optimal**: Files under 10MB load in under 1 second
- **Acceptable**: Files up to 100MB load in 2-5 seconds
- **Large files**: Files over 100MB may take significantly longer

**Performance Characteristics:**
- **10MB files**: ~0.5 seconds (optimized)
- **100MB files**: ~4 seconds (with UI optimizations)
- **Files >100MB**: Performance degrades significantly and depends on machine configuration

**Machine Configuration Impact:**
- **RAM**: More RAM allows for better memory mapping of large files
- **Storage**: SSD vs HDD affects file reading speed
- **CPU**: Faster processors improve JSON parsing performance
- **Available memory**: System memory pressure can slow down large file processing

**Technical Limitations:**
- Files larger than 100MB use conservative UI updates to maintain responsiveness
- Very large files (>500MB) may cause memory pressure on systems with limited RAM
- JSON validation time scales with file size complexity, not just file size
- Large arrays/objects (>100 items) use virtualized rendering to prevent UI freezing

**Recommendations:**
- For files over 100MB, consider splitting into smaller files if possible
- Ensure adequate system RAM (8GB+ recommended for files >50MB)
- Use SSD storage for better file I/O performance
- Close other memory-intensive applications when working with large JSON files
